# Introduction
In this article, I would like to share with you my methods that will help you in learning foreign languages. In my case, it is German. During my German language studies, I noticed that AI can help in many aspects of learning. In this article, I will describe how I used AI to generate homework checking.

## Learning Foreign Languages
My problem was validating my homework. I used to lose about 5-10 minutes at the beginning of each new lesson checking my homework. I would rather spend that time learning than checking. And once again, AI to the rescue. All I had to do was paste a photo of my homework into the AI chat and ask it to check it.

But how to do it? I used the AI chat to check my homework. I took a photo of my homework and pasted it into the chat. The AI chat recognized the text in the photo and provided me with the results.

This way, I had more time for learning and also the assurance that my homework was correct. When I had any doubts about the correctness of my homework, I consulted the results with a tutor, and when I was sure that the results were correct, we moved directly on to the next lesson. I paste the AI chat response into my homework.

> Now, imagine taking it one step further. Instead of simply receiving a result confirming that we completed the homework correctly, we would also record all the vocabulary that appeared in the homework. This way, we can build a database of words that we can review in the future. In this way, we will enhance our knowledge and language skills.

# Get Early Access to Our App
We are excited to announce that we are working on an innovative app that not only checks your homework using AI, but also extracts vocabulary from your assignments and automatically creates flashcards for you. Imagine having all your language learning material organized and ready for review, giving you more time to focus on actually learning!

## Summary
In summary, the use of artificial intelligence can streamline the learning process. AI helps in generating notes from online courses, facilitates the learning of foreign languages by checking homework through a photo attachment, and also supports the understanding of new information. This allows us to focus on the key aspects of learning, maximizing efficiency and accelerating our development.
